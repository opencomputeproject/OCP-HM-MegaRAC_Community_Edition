    Implement to emit D-Bus signal for PLDM Event Messages. PLDM Event
    Messages are PLDM monitoring and control messages that are used by
    a PLDM terminus to synchronously or asynchronously report PLDM events
    to a central party called the PLDM Event Receiver.

    When the PLDM daemon receives a sensorEvent of type stateSensorState,
    it emits the StateSensorEvent signal.

    This signal would be used by PLDM Requester apps on the BMC, which
    will rely on this signal to determine state changes on a connected
    PLDM entity.

    More information about PLDM Event Messages can be found at DSP0248
    version 1.2.0 section 13.

signals:
    - name: StateSensorEvent
      description: >
          Signal indicating that a state sensor change EventMessage is
          received.
          More information about properties can be found at DSP0248 version
          1.2.0 table 19.
      properties:
        - name: TID
          type: byte

            A terminus id.

        - name: sensorID

          description: >
            The sensorID is the value that is used in PDRs and PLDM sensor
            access commands to identify and access a particular sensor
            within a terminus.

        - name: sensorOffset
          type: byte
          description: >
            Identifies which state sensor within a composite state sensor
            the event is being returned for.

        - name: eventState
          type: byte
          description: >
            The event state value from the state change that triggered
            the event message.

        - name: previousEventState
          type: byte
          description: >
            The event state value for the state from which the present
            event state was entered.
