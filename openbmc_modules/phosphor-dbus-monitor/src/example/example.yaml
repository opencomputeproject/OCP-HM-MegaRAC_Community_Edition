    'Conditions or conditional callbacks apply a test prior to invoking
    the callback function.

    All conditional callbacks must specify the callback to issue if
    the condition evaluates.

    The count condition applies the op comparison operator to the value of each
    property in the specified groups.  It then counts the number of properties
    that pass the comparison, and applies another comparison on the result
    against the specified bound.

    For example, a callback that requires at least three temperature sensors
    in the group to be higher than 115 degrees might use a count condition
    with an op of >, a count op of >=, a bound of 115, and a countbound of 3.

    The optional oneshot parameter defaults to false.  If it is specified and
    set to true, then the callback will only be called once for as long as the
    condition is repeatedly passing.  The condition needs to fail at least
    once to rearm the callback.'
