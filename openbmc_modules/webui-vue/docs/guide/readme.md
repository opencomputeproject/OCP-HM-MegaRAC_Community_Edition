# Getting Started

This guide outlines the architecture and technologies used to build the OpenBMC Web UI. This guide exists to serve the following goals:

1. Improve contributor efficiency while maintaining the quality and consistency of the user interface
1. Act as a collection of community agreed-upon standards

## Coding Standards
Having an understanding of semantic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is the critical knowledge required to contribute to this project. The frameworks and libraries used to build this UI include:
- [Vue](https://vuejs.org/)
- [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/)
- [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org/)
- [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
- [Bootstrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/)
- [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate.js.org/)
- [Vue I18n](https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/)

::: tip
Acquiring an understanding of these technologies will also be necessary.

You will find more information about the standards and best practices in the [Coding Standards section of this guide](/coding-standards/).
