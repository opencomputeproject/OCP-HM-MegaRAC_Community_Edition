# Colors
This color palette has been agreed upon by the OpenBMC community and differs from the Bootstrap color patterns. The OpenBMC palette includes custom hex values, along with additional blue, green, red, and yellow color variables used as accent colors for components. The `.scss` component files use these accent colors to override default styles set by the Bootstrap library.

## All Colors
`All Colors` is the term Bootstrap uses to describe the colors that make up the `colors` map. These colors and the Grays color variables define the  `theme-colors` map colors.

## Theme Colors
The theme colors are keys in the `theme-colors` map. Bootstrap-Vue has a variant prop that accepts any of the `theme-colors` keys to set the theme of a component.
