#Example fan monitor definitions for phosphor-fan-monitor

#List the fans that need to be monitored, along with some
#properties that define how much slack is allowed in the actual
#tach value as compared to the target tach value.

#fans:
# - inventory:
#    [The system inventory location for the fan]
#  functional_delay:
#    [Delay (in secs) before a fan is marked functional after returning
#     within the allowed deviation]
#  allowed_out_of_range_time:
#    [Time (in secs) actual speed can be outside of deviation of
#     target speed]
#  deviation:
#    [Percentage that actual speed must be within target speed]
#  num_sensors_nonfunc_for_fan_nonfunc:
#    [How many sensors on the fan must be faulted before fan
#     will be considered faulted]
#  sensors: [array of speed sensors for the fan]
#    - name [The name of the fan sensor]
#      has_target [true|false  If this sensor has a Target property for
#                  setting a fan speed (otherwise just for reads)]
#      target_interface [The fan target interface used by the sensor.
#                        Default is "xyz.openbmc_project.Control.FanSpeed"]
#      factor [The factor to multiply with target to calculate the expected
#              fan speed. Default is 1 for fan speed target;
#              Customized value for pwm target]
#      offset [The offset to add to calculate the expected fan speed.
#              Default is 0 for fan speed target;
#              Customized value for pwm target]
#  condition: [optional condition function to create fan functional monitoring]
#    name: [The name of an available condition function]
#    properties: [The properties used in the condition function]
#        - object: [Object path of property to use]
#          interface: [Interface of property to use]
#          property:
#              name: [Property name]
#              type: [Property data type]
#              value: [Property value to check condition against]
#
#sensor_trust_groups:
# - class: [Group class name
#           Available classes:
#           * NonzeroSpeed - Only trust if at least one sensor in the group
#                            has a nonzero speed.]
#   group:
#     - name [The name of the fan sensor in this group]
#       in_trust: [true|false] (optional)
#         [Include in trust determination or not. Default = true]

#The code uses these parameters as follows:
#  After a speed reading of a sensor is outside of the allowed deviation of
#  the target speed for the allowed out of range time, if at least
#  num_sensors_nonfunc_for_fan_nonfunc sensors meet this condition,
#  the fan will be set to nonfunctional in the inventory.
#
#  Sensor trust groups are used to specify that the speed values for the
#  sensors in a group cannot be trusted based on some condition, where
#  the condition is based on the class used to implement the group.  All
#  sensors in the group go in and out of trust based on those defined
#  to be part of determining the trust.  This section is optional.
