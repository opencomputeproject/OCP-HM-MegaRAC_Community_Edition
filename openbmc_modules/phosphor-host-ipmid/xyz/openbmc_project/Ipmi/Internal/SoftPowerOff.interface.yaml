  Implement the Soft Power Off function.
  On receiving the SMS_ATTN from BMC, Host will respond with a
  GetMessageFlags command and the BMC will respond with a static
  data indicating that Event Message Buffer is full. Host then sends
  'ReadEvent' command and BMC responds with an architected packet
  mentioning that the type is SOFT_OFF. Host then goes ahead and starts
  to quiesce. Once that is done, Host will send a hard
  power off command to BMC and then BMC will issue a hard power off.

properties:
    - name: ResponseReceived
      type: enum[self.HostResponse]
      default: NotApplicable
      description: >
        When the response is received for 'SMS_ATN', this is set to
        'SoftOffReceived' and is set to 'HostShutdown' when Host
        sends a Power Off request.

          description: >
            Host has received the SMS_ATN from BMC indicating that
            Host needs to do a Soft Power Off.
        - name: HostShutdown
          description: >
            Host has sufficiently quiesced and acknowledged the shutdown
            request such that the hardware shutdown sequence can safely
            be performed.
