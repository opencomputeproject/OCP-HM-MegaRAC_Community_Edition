    Implement to notify the creation of new dump.
    Use this interface when the dump is already created and ready
    to be offloaded. This interface will add a new dump object with the
    properties provided. The existing internal create interface should
    be used when the data is collected and the dump needs to be packaged.

    Any OpenBMC implementation must provide exactly one implementation of
    xyz.openbmc_project.Dump.NewDump on /xyz/openbmc_project/dump.

             The dump id provided by the source of the dump.
             There are dumps which get generated outside the BMC, like a
             system dump which gets generated and stored in the host memory.
             All dumps will have a  unique id  but when communicating
             to the source of the dump the SourceDumpId will be used.
