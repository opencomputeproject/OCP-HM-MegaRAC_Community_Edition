   Implementation of BMC state management.  When rebooting we are in
   transition.  When Ready all services required are running
   successfully.  When we are Not Ready this implies not all services
   have started that are required to be.

properties:
   - name: RequestedBMCTransition
     type: enum[self.Transition]
     default: 'None'

   - name: CurrentBMCState
     type: enum[self.BMCState]
     description: >
         The current state of the BMC and is a read-only property.

   - name: LastRebootTime
     type: uint64
     description: >

           Ready implies all services started and are running successfully
       - name: 'NotReady'
