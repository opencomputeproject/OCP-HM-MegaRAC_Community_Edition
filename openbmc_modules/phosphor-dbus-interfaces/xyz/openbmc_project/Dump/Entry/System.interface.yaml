    Implement this to add system dump management.

    System dumps are dump of the host memory and hardware states
    generated during a failure in the host firmware. This can be a huge
    dump stored in the host memory, the BMC doesnt store this dump but
    stream this dump to an external client based on the offload request.
    Apart from system generated system dump, users can also request for
    this kind of dump.

properties:
    - name: SourceDumpId
      type: uint32
      description: >
          The dump id provided by the source of the dump.
          There are dumps which get generated outside the BMC, like a
          system dump which gets generated and stored in the host memory.
          All dumps will have a  unique id  but when communicating
          to the source of the dump the SourceDumpId will be used.
