methods:
    - name: Send

          Pass through a command to the OCC.
      parameters:
        - name: command
          # TODO via https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/issues/1160. This should
          # change to array[byte]. As of now, the REST server maps any numeric
          # data to int32.
          type: array[int32]
          description: >
              An array of integers representing the command and payload. This
              should still be bytes worth of data (as though using array[byte]),
              so each entry in the array should pack as many bytes as possible.
      returns:
        - name: response
          # TODO via https://github.com/openbmc/openbmc/issues/1160. This should
          # change to array[byte]. As of now, the REST server maps any numeric
          # data to int32.
