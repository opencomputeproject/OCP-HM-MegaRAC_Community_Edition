    Implement to provide fan speed control. The method of control is hardware
    dependent and objects implementing Control.FanSpeed must be instantiated
    within the sensors/fan_tach namespace.

    Any service implementing Control.FanSpeed on one or more objects must
    implement xyz.openbmc_project.Sensors.Value on the object and
    org.freedesktop.DBus.ObjectManager on the sensors namespace root.

    All Control.FanSpeed properties are read/write.
