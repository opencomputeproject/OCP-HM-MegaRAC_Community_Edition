    Implement to schedule Epoch time to power on/off the Host.
properties:
    - name: ScheduledTime
      type: uint64
      default: 0
      description: >
          ScheduledTime is a date time when the host will be
          powered on/off. The time is the Epoch time, number
          of seconds since 1 Jan 1970 00::00::00 UTC.

          When ScheduledTime is 0, it means the functionality
          is disabled.
          When ScheduledTime is smaller than current time,
          error InvalidTime will be thrown.
          When the controller detects the ScheduledTime has passed,
          it will execute the ScheduledTransition and reset the
          value to 0. Once the transition starts, there won't be
          any retries.
          When the real time changes, the controller shall check if
          the time is still in the future. If so, it will stop the
          existing timer and restart it with new wait time. Otherwise,
          stop the existing timer and execute the ScheduledTransition.
          When ScheduledTime is reached, but the host is not ready
          to power on/off, e.g. when BMC is rebooting, BMC shall
          set the host ScheduledTransition after it is ready.

          The default operation supports scheduled power on.
